# Acme Alarm Inc (front end)

It's a react app for Acme Alarm Inc.

I can't link to the demo because you lot would use it to spam your friends.

It lets you set alarms. When the alarms go off, it calls a phone number and plays them a Rick Astley song.

There's [an API that goes with this](https://github.com/fakedarren/acme-alarm-inc-api) too.


## Installing and running

- `npm install`
- Copy `.env.sample` to `.env.local` (and update as appropriate)
- `npm start`
